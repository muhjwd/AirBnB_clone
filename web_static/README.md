#AirBnB Clone Project

The objective of this project is to create a replicated version of the AirBnB website on the sandbox

Rather than implementing all of AirBnB's features, we will focus on a selection that encompasses the fundamental concepts of higher-level programming.

Our application will consist of the following components:

A command interpreter for manipulating data via a text-based interface, similar to a Shell.
A website that showcases both static and dynamic content.
A data storage system, utilizing either a database or files to store information.
An API that serves as a communication interface between the front-end and our data.
